    "# ChinesePod Web Scraper (Library List)\n",
    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook is an implementation of a simple web scraper designed to scrape the details of the lessons available on ChinesePod. This script does not download the lesson notes, mp3 files or other materials. The purpose of this project is for me to become familiar with web scraping and how to wrangle the data into a usable format. I chose this as a project because I have been studying Chinese (普通话）for a while and I am interested in subscribing to their service. I have watched many of their freely available videos on Youtube and their material appears to be of very high quality. The reason I am considering subscribing to their service is that I think it may help improve my listening skills and extend my vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few questions for which I would like to find answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many of levels are there and how many lessons in each level?\n",
    "- What are their names?\n",
    "- How many lessons for each level.\n",
    "- How many video lessons?\n",
    "- How many audio only lessons?\n",
    "- How many different teachers are there?\n",
    "- How often do they produce lessons?\n",
    "- How long have they been making lessons?\n",
    "- They haven't always made video lessons, how long have they been doing this?\n",
    "- What are the most common topics covered in the lessons?\n",
    "- and so on ....\n",
    "\n",
    "The scraped data and will studied and visualised and used to answer the above questions in a separate notebook ([ChinesePod_Explore.ipynb](ChinesePod_Explore.ipynb)).\n",
